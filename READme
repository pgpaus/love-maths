Hi, 

Welcome to my Love Maths project. I am using the code institute template and following the videos along with the code. 
[this template](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/gitpod-full-template) 
This project shows my basic knowledge in HTML, CSS and JavaScript. 

I simplified the template game code for children getting to know maths to use.
